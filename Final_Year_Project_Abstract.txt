This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based stock market portfolio optimization tool 
aimed at helping users maximize returns while minimizing risk.
By leveraging a deep learning model, such as LSTM, 
for stock price prediction and integrating public sentiment analysis from news and social media using models like BERT, 
the tool provides users with dynamic market insights. 
Additionally, portfolio optimization techniques, such as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and reinforcement learning,
are applied to suggest the most efficient allocation of assets, allowing users to make informed and calculated investment decisions.
