# Stock Market Portfolio Optimisation With DeepLearning & Public Sentiment Analysis
It is a daunting task to invest in stocks especially for beginners which may lead to big risks. 
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based tool for stock market portfolio optimization.
It utilises LSTM models for accurate stock price prediction based on historical data.
Public sentiment analysis from news and social media (Twitter) is integrated using models like BERT to provide market insights.
The tool applies Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and reinforcement learning to optimize asset allocation.
The goal is to help users maximize returns while minimizing risk through data-driven, informed investment decisions.
