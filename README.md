# EI-Study_Coding-Assessment
Using different design pattern use cases to do two exercises.
## Exercise 1
Come up creatively with six different use cases to demonstrate your understanding of the following software design patterns by coding the
same.
1. Two use cases to demonstrate two behavioural design pattern.
2. Two use cases to demonstrate two creational design pattern.
3. Two use cases to demonstrate two structural design pattern.
## Exercise 2 - Satellite Commanding System
Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a Satellite Command System that simulates controlling a satellite in orbit. The satellite starts in a default
initial state and can accept a series of commands to change its orientation, solar panel status, and data collection.
